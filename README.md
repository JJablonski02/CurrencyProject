# CurrencyProject

It is Model-View-Controller Currency Rate Project. In DTO's there is formatted json response API. Project contains 2 controllers. First of them refers to
home page and exchange currency rate page. Another controller refers to historical values. There are 4 views written mainly in html, but aswell you can
find there some css and javascript sections.

Project is being still improved, so you can expect changes/upgrades in code in time.

Project is fully written by me - Jakub Jablonski.
